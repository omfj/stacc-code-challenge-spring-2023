# Stacc Code Challenge Spring 2023

This is my submission for the Stacc Code Challenge Spring 2023.

## Technology

This application uses the t3-stack as a template because it reduces the amount
of time I have to spend setting up the project. Also, it has all the
great technologies I love, mainly NextJS, TailwindCSS, tRPC and TypeScript.
The database is hosted on [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/).
